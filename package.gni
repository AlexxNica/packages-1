# Defines a package
#
# The package template is used to define a unit of related code and data.
# A package always has a name (defaulting to the target name) and lists of
# scopes describing the components of the package.
#
# Parameters
#
#   app (bool, optional)
#     If true, changes the default location of binaries from
#     |"bin/" + binary.name| to |"apps/" + binary.name|.
#
#   archive (bool, optional)
#     If true, the package is stored in a Fuchsia Archive rather than directly
#     in the system boot image.
#
#     Cannot be used with the drivers parameter because the system is not yet
#     sophisticated enough to load drivers out of archives.
#
#   meta (optional)
#     List of scopes defining the metadata entries in the package. A metadata
#     entry is typically a source file and is placed in the "meta/" directory of
#     the assembled package.
#
#     Requires |archive| to be true.
#
#     Entries in a scope in the meta list:
#
#       source (path, required)
#         Location of entry in source or build directory. If the resource is
#         checked in, this will typically be specified as a path relative to the
#         BUILD.gn file containing the package() rule. If the resource is
#         generated, this will typically be specified relative to
#         $target_gen_dir
#
#       dest (path, required)
#         Location the resource will be placed within "meta/"
#
#   binaries (optional)
#     List of scopes defining the binaries in the package. A binary is typically
#     produced by the build system and is placed in the "bin/" directory of the
#     assembled package.
#
#     Entries in a scope in the binaries list:
#
#       name (string, required)
#         Name of the binary
#
#       source (path, optional)
#         Location of the binary in the build directory if it is not at
#         $root_build_dir/$name
#
#       dest (path, optional)
#         Location the binary will be placed within "bin/"
#
#   tests (optional)
#     List of scopes defining the test binaries in the package. A test is
#     typically produced by the build system and is placed in the "test/"
#     directory of the assembled package.
#
#     Entries in a scope in the tests list:
#
#       name (string, required)
#         Name of the test
#
#   drivers (optional)
#     List of scopes defining the drivers in the package. A driver is typically
#     produced by the build system and is placed in the "driver" directory
#     of the assembled package.
#
#     Entries in a scope in the drivers list:
#
#       name (string, required)
#         Name of the driver
#
#       early_boot_driver (bool, optional)
#         Set if this driver must be available at early boot time. Most drivers
#         should not set this.
#
#   libraries (optional)
#     List of scopes defining the (shared) libraries in the package. A library
#     is placed in the "lib/" directory of the assembled package.
#
#     Entries in a scope in the libraries list:
#
#       name (string, required)
#         Name of the library
#
#       used_by_early_boot_drivers (bool, optional)
#         Set to true if this library is used by a boot driver. This will place
#         the library in a location accessible to drivers during early boot as
#         well as other programs.
#
#   resources (optional)
#      List of scopes defining the resources in the package. A resource is a
#      data file that may be produced by the build system, checked in to a
#      source repository, or produced by another system that runs before the
#      build. Resources are placed in the "data/" directory of the assembled
#      package.
#
#     Entries in a scope in the resources list:
#
#       path (path, required)
#         Location of resource in source or build directory. If the resource is
#         checked in, this will typically be specified as a path relative to the
#         BUILD.gn file containing the package() rule. If the resource is
#         generated, this will typically be specified relative to
#         $target_gen_dir
#
#       dest (path, required)
#         Location the resource will be placed within "data/"

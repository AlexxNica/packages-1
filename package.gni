# Defines a package
#
# The package template is used to define a unit of related code and data.
# A package always has a name (defaulting to the target name) and lists of
# scopes describing the components of the package.
#
# Parameters
#
#   binaries (optional)
#     List of scopes defining the binaries in the package. A binary is typically
#     produced by the build system and is placed in the "bin/" directory of the
#     assembled package.
#
#     Entries in a scope in the binaries list:
#
#       name (string, required)
#         Name of the binary
#
#       source (path, optional)
#         Location of the binary in the build directory if it is not at
#         $root_build_dir/$name
#
#       app (bool, optional)
#         If true, binary will be placed in "app/" instead of "bin/"
#
#   drivers (optional)
#     List of scopes defining the drivers in the package. A driver is typically
#     produced by the build system and is placed in the "driver" directory
#     of the assembled package.
#
#     Temporarily, drivers are mapped to the "/boot" bootfs instead of the
#     "/system" bootfs most other package components are mapped into, pending
#     improvements to the device manager.
#
#     Entries in a scope in the drivers list:
#
#       name (string, required)
#         Name of the driver
#
#   libraries (optional)
#     List of scopes defining the (shared) libraries in the package. A library
#     is placed in the "lib/" directory of the assembled package.
#
#     Entries in a scope in the libraries list:
#
#       name (string, required)
#         Name of the library
#
#   resources (optional)
#      List of scopes defining the resources in the package. A resource is a
#      data file that may be produced by the build system, checked in to a
#      source repository, or produced by another system that runs before the
#      build. Resources are placed in the "data/" directory of the assembled
#      package.
#
#     Entries in a scope in the resources list:
#
#       source (path, required)
#         Location of resource in source or build directory. If the resource is
#         checked in, this will typically be specified as a path relative to the
#         BUILD.gn file containing the package() rule. If the resource is
#         generated, this will typically be specified relative to
#         $target_gen_dir
#
#       dest (path, required)
#         Location the resource will be placed within "data/"

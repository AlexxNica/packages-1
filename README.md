# Packages

Fuchsia package repository contains files needed to build all official packages
which are part of Fuchsia operating system (but not the packages themselves nor
the source files of the software).

See [Build Overview &gt;
Modules](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/docs/+/master/build_overview.md#modules)
for more discussion of packages and modules.
